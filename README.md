# Portfolio page placeholder project

This page was created simply as a placeholder as I worked on my HTML and CSS skills before creating a more fully featured site.

## What I learned

Even though this was a simple placeholder, I really enjoyed thinking of a theme and visual style for this page. I created a replica of my VS Studio Code theme,
 complete with animated cursor. It felt empowering to finally have my own webpage on the internet for anyone to see, even as basic as it was.
